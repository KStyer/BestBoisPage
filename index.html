<h1>
    The Best Bois with a Basketball
</h1>
<div>
<p>
Vermin are a man's best friend. No, really!
Rats are a highly underrated companion animal. Capable of puzzle solving and eager to impress, rats give dogs a run for their money in trick training.
They are social creatures that bond readily with humans and enjoy play, cuddles, and competitive challenges. 

</p>
<p>
    One such competition that rats can participate in is basketball. A few colleges have trained rat basketball teams who compete in tournaments. 
    While our team never competed against opposing teams, they are a great example of how you can train your new favorite pets at home. Let's introduce our boys.

<p>In order from left to right, we have:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Oslo </li>
    <li> Eero </li>
    <li> Yannick </li>
    <li> Mies </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Mies was the most driven and accurate out of the group. Yannick was right behind him, always keeping up with Mies. Eero scored enough baskets to prove he could do it, but preferred to drink tea and watch. Oslo loved stealing the ball and keeping the game exciting for the others.
</p>

<p> Here is a video of them playing basketball together. Mies and Yannick are on one team, while Eero and Oslo are on the other team.
